## Existing PCB tools

- What tool did you use to make PCBs?
  - KiCAD
  - EagleCAD
  - Altium Designer
  - EasyCAD
- What problems do you have with current ones?
  - easy to learn?
  - easy to use?
  - efficient?
  - GUI editing is inefficient, e.g. dragging components and draw lines, manual placement and routing
  - lack of abstraction and reuse, e.g. define functions, if, loop

## BHDL

- What programming languages do you use?
  - python
  - C/C++
  - jave
  - javascript
- Do you think the BHDL code is
  - easy to read?
  - easy to understand?
  - easy to learn? how likely do you want to try to learn such a new tool?
  - make your design faster?
  - easy to share (whole design or reusable components)?
- compare BHDL with GUI CAD tools
- Any problems/suggestions with BHDL?

## Dev Platform

- Dev env
  - Do you prefer local or online develop/design environment?
  - Do you know jupyter notebooks?
- Which Editor/IDE do you use?
  - VScode
  - InteliJ
  - Vim/Emacs+commandline
  - Jupyter notebook
  - Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL)
- Do you want to use a GitHub platform to store/share your PCB designs?
- online dev platform
  - ready to use
  - powerful, compiles fast
  - accessible everywhere
  - share with friends, collaborative editing
- Will you pay for
  - expert helpdesk
  - expert design for you
  - libraries and sub-designs
